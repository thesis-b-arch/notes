Giving materiality to technology.

He mentioned how the aesthetic of the technological materiality is indicative of the baroque. I affirmed his observation by saying that my mental image (which I tried illustrating in my first conceptual graphic) is the image of technology as an invasive speciece of vine that is slowly (well, pretty quickly actually) eating architecture from the outside in and from the inside out. I mean, look at Times Square. Those buildings were there before all those lights and tv screens showed up. I honestly couldn't tell you what the buildings in Times Square look like, but I can tell you what technology is on them and what information the technology communicated to me. Finally, we are seeing more and more buildings being redone/altered on the inside to accommodate for technology. Buildings are made, and the technology is being tacked onto the inside and outside immediately after. Shouldn't that be a qeue for architects? 
For a while, he referenced the Futurists and Lebbeus Woods. These people are only really relevant in terms of aesthetics. They were all artists. However, he called me out saying that I never talk about aesthetics. I outwardly express an work towards ends which meet my interest in the functionality of the technology, but subconsciously I am creating an aesthetic. That really encouraged me. He said, I don't talk aesthetics, I do it. And perhaps that's true. I look at my work thusfar and visually I am content, surprised even, but most of the desicions driving that were directly influenced by the technology it is accommodating.
