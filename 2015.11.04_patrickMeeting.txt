Apparently wood against concrete is a recipe for disaster. I have to have some sort of buffer material in between because wood mustn't be exposed to moisture. The concrete has to be cast so that it already has space for other members to be recieved. 
With that in mind, I have to make sure I stop the wood elements at the finish floor level, then allow the concrete to continue down below. 
Now, I had a feeling about how the wood needed to be stopped prior to the concrete. What was new to me was the fact that I had to have the concrete made frist, then place materials inside it. 
Perhaps this confirms that this model is not a wall section, but a column section. That's pretty interesting actually. I can place the column near the wall if I so wish. I could have it in the middle of the space. I have to consider the way it looks on from all angles. I'm glad it's a column actually. I think it's a better scale for the technology. A wall is too large and would dwarf the technology. I guess this means that I would consider the technology to be released from the exterior wall.
